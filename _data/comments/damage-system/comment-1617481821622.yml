message: "My main issue with no shields of done sort is the fact that you can only heal by going to a shipyard.\r\nThink of a game where after getting hit you could only heal by going back to town. Now think of an exploration game where you have the same limit.\r\nThe need to go back severely limits the ability of the players to go out explor and act with the game world.\r\nThey will always want to be close to a shipyard inorder to feel safe.\r\nIf you with to only have armor then you need to have the ability for field repair. Maybe by collecting or expanding certain resources."
