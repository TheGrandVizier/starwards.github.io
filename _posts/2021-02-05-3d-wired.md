More 3D rendering. This time it's wired into the game's logic. Connecting the 3D view to the game's logic is coming along nicely. I've started by duplicating the same mechanism used for the 2D radar, making the required adjustments for the different rendering solution.

I'm trying to figure out the basic orientation concepts: which Axis is pointing where, and what's the meaning of all these rotation types (yaw, pitch, roll). In the attached clip I'm actually flying the ship in the game, but the 3D rendering logic interprets the ship's rotations wrong.

After hours of playing around like this, testing different solutions, trying to catch a glimpse of them with the 3D viewport, it dawned on me that I should disable the fighter's AI so that things will stop moving around. Doh!
