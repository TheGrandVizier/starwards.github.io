Today we've recorded a presentation of the dogfight experience. 

We've covered many topics, including: basic maneuvering, afterburner, flight control modes, space physics, locking on target, following a target, air-burst sight adjustments, deflection sight, and some nifty maneuvers.
We've also established who is the better pilot. 

Watch it on youtube:
