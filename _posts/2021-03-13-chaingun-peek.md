First look on the [chaingun weapon system]({% link _posts/2021-03-06-chaingun.md %}), the main weapon system we choose for our first fighter.

In the video below, you can see the fighter shooting a hail of deadly 30MM airburst shells. The orange target icon is an indicator to where the shells will detonate.
The distance can be adjusted manually by the pilot or will be adjusted automatically when the system is locked on an enemy ship.
