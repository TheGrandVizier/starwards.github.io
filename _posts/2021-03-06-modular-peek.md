As we see Starwards as a platform to run LARPs in different sizes and amounts of players, we wanted to allow a dynamic process for creating the different screens and stations for the game. 

We are looking to break all the systems to thier basic component level and offer them as a widget. The game organizers can drag the various widgets in order to build the screens they want. There is no limit to the number of screens the organisers can build, or to the number of screens any widget can be part of.

It will be possible to save and name the screens and then access them quickly from a URL. In addition, the game masters will be able to quickly add to their screens any widget they need at any point in time, to take over or spy on stations.

On the video below, you can see the process of dragging and resizing the different components we have now to create a screen
