## Introducing the Chain gun

We are happy to introduce our first close range weapon system, which will be used by our first fighter models in the game – The Chain gun!

### What is a Chain gun?

A chain gun is a type of [machine gun]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun) or [autocannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocannon) that uses an external power source for cycling the weapon's action (. Unlike most automatic firearms, it doesn’t use any power from the gas or recoil of the cartridge after it has been fired [(blowback)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowback_(firearms)). The weapon is called a chain gun due to its motorcycle-like chain connected to an electric motor that cycling the weapon.
