## Introducing the Chain gun

We are happy to introduce our first close range weapon system, which will be used by our first fighter models in the game – The Chain gun!

### What is a Chain gun?

A chain gun is a type of [machine gun]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun) or [autocannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocannon) that uses an external power source for cycling the weapon's action (. Unlike most automatic firearms, it doesn’t use any power from the gas or recoil of the cartridge after it has been fired [(blowback)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowback_(firearms)). The weapon is called a chain gun due to its motorcycle-like chain connected to an electric motor that cycling the weapon.

### Why the Chain gun?

The Chain gun weapon system has few benefits which make it logical to be used for space-combat. 

Reliability and durability – Chain gun weapon systems are extremely reliable as they not depending on the firing of a cartridge to power the cycle of the action. Therefore, if a round is misfired, it doesn’t stop the functioning of the weapon, it will just be ejected, and new round will be loaded.

Controllability is another advantage of the Chain gun over the blowback mechanisms.  It is possible to vary the motor speed in order to control the rate of fire. This feature is helping with obtaining maximum rate of fire that is the safest to the gun at the moment, helps with heat management and extraction of fumes. 

In a famous test that was conducted by the US Navy, 29,721 rounds were fired by an EX-34 Chain gun, and the operators were not faced with any jam or stoppage.
