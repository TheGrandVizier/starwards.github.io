## Introducing the Chain gun

We are happy to introduce our first close range weapon system, which will be used by our first fighter models in the game – The Chain gun!

### What is a Chain gun?

A chain gun is a type of [machine gun]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun) or [autocannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocannon) that uses an external power source for cycling the weapon's action (. Unlike most automatic firearms, it doesn’t use any power from the gas or recoil of the cartridge after it has been fired [(blowback)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowback_(firearms)). The weapon is called a chain gun due to its motorcycle-like chain connected to an electric motor that cycling the weapon.

### Examples

Gas operated blowback mechanism:

### Why the Chain gun?

The Chain gun weapon system has a couple of benefits that make it the perfect choice for space combat. 

Reliability and durability – Chain gun weapon systems are incredibly reliable as they not depending on the firing of a cartridge to power the cycle of the action. Therefore, if a round is misfired, it doesn’t stop the functioning of the weapon, it will just be ejected, and a new round will be loaded.

Controllability is another advantage of the Chain gun over the blowback mechanisms.  It is possible to vary the motor speed in order to control the rate of fire. This feature helps obtain the maximum rate of fire that is the safest to the gun at the moment, helps with heat management and extraction of fumes. 

In a famous test that the US Navy conducted, 29,721 rounds were fired by an EX-34 Chain gun, and the operators were not faced with even one jam or stoppage. 

## Ammunition 

Ammunition is a significant part of any weapon system. In the end, this will be what will hit and destroy the target.

It makes sense to have a different type of ammunition for different roles, but as our first milestone is to create a dog-fight between two space fighters, we should start with ammunition that will be best fitted for this role.

Therefore, it was decided that the first ammunition that we will create will be the Airburst ammunition. 

### What is Airburst ammunition?

Airburst round is a type of ammunition that detonates midair instead of upon contact with the target. The detention midair causes [air burst effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_burst) and damage the target with fragmentation. A fire control computer or sighting system is used to program the round to explode at the required distance.

This round has benefits in both anti-air and anti-personnel systems:

Anti-personnel – Apart from the better disperse of the fragmentation, using airburst round provides the ability to penetrate or fly over hardcover and hit the target behind it. For example, a target hiding behind a concrete wall.

Anti-air – The round will explode near the aircraft/missile and increase the chance to hit with fragmentation.  Obviously, this use is more relevant to our case.
