In one of our very first product brainstorming, we discussed what will be the first milestone for Starwards. We agreed that we want to have a fully working dogfight between two ships.
This decision brought up a dilemma: are we going to have a "fighter" ship class in our game? 

## Why we want fighters 
 Fast and highly maneuverable single-seated fighters are probably the most iconic spacecraft. You can find them in almost any type of Sci-Fi representation. 

 Space fighters are a great way to introduce high paced and exciting combat – from classic dogfight combat to squadrons fight versus capital ships and up to reconnaissance missions. 

 From a LARP perspective, using fighters will easily allow us to add single-seat stations to our game, providing the ability to increase the number of players (and ships!) without the need to add more bridges. 
 
 Fighters can easily turn into unmanned “Drones” which is also a solution for different activities on the ship. 

## What is the issue with fighters
As you read and most certainly will read many times in this dev blog, Starwards is a low/hard Sci-Fi game. This means using practical technology and real, current physics. Within such a setting, there are some major questions to be asked when considering the justification of  human-operated space fighters. As we strive to create a world with coherent internal reasoning, justification is a big deal for us. 

The human body requires special condition to operate, which are hard to come by in space : atmosphere, temperatu


A human-operated vessel will most always be out-maneuvered by a weapon. 


Many times, the space fighter is just an oversized fighter jet that flies in space instead of the atmosphere (and sometimes in both).

We could really try to explain the issues with the role of the space fighter in a realistic space environment but feel it will be a bit pointless when somebody else did it so well. 


The YouTube channel "First-Pass" addressed that subject perfectly, in his explanation of why there are no space fighters in the world of the “Expanse” (one of our main influences):

## The decision
After giving it a deep thought, we have decided that even though we strive to deliver a “Hard Sci-Fi” experience, we need firstly to promote features that we believe will contribute to the LARP experience.
As the main reason for the inability of space fighters to perform in settings like the “Expanse” is the weapon systems, it means that we need to make sure that we design a combat environment that will justify the existence of space fighters. If we can do that without sacrificing too much of the realism, we could present a good compromise between fun, the needs for LARP, and the settings we are striving for.
