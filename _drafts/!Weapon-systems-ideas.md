## "Guns. Lots of Guns"

One of the first discussions we had after deciding on our first milestone (playable dogfight) was regarding the weapon systems we will have in our game. After all, having a dogfight without the ability to destroy the opponent ship will end as a pretty dull dogfight.
As we already agreed that we would have space fighters, we understood that the first weapon system we will need to design would be suitable to be used by small ships and for close range.

## Range in space?

Close range? Some of you might question the above statement, as the range for weapons in space can prove to be a bit tricky. After all, if I"m firing a projectile in space, it is will keep flying until it hits something. Unlike firing on the surface, there is no gravity or air friction to slow down my projectile.

### Diffrenet weapons for each range

If our weapons don't have range limitations, the weapon's actual limit is how well it is performing in different engagement ranges. For example, a hail of bullets might be extremely dangerous in very close ranges but very easy to avoid in long ranges of the projectile's extremely small size and speed.
This means we need to think about weapon systems that would be effective in different engagement ranges. 

## The three circles 

We decided to divide the engagement ranges into three circles - close, intermediate, and long. The idea behind these circles is to define types of engagement, which will be different from each other and will employ diverse combat styles. Each weapon system in the game will belong to one of these engagement circles, where the exact range could be affected by the specific weapon system, ship’s sensors, firing computer, and more.   

Close range – This engagement range will include any weapon systems designed to fight within close proximity to the vessel. They are usually not very accurate and relying more on the rate of fire and projectile’s velocity. [CIWS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-in_weapon_system) is an excellent example of a weapon system that belongs to the close engagement range circle.
