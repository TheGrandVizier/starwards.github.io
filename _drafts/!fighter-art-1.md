We've been looking for a 3-D model for the fighter ship from the [dogfight](/tags/#dogfight). We've searched the usual places, offering free and paid 3-D models for gaming, but we could not find a design that fit what we had in mind.
Our requirements were more specific than we initially thought. To satisfy our high bar of realism in our game rationale, we wanted the design to portrait a small (1-2 seats) ship that operates only in space (so, no wings), heavily armored, with a single weapon - the chaingun. 

in general built more like a tank or a mecha than a minbari ship.
